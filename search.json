    "text": "Description\n\nContent\nIn today‚Äôs digital age, the majority of scientific insights in psychological research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, ‚ÄúWhich version of my data and code did I use to get this result?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis code used to work! What did I change?‚Äù. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git.\n\n\nGoals\nThe primary aim of this course is to empower students with the skills to efficiently organize projects on their computers using Git and GitHub. Participants will actively engage in hands-on experiences with these tools, exploring both the command-line and Graphical User Interfaces. Proficiency in Git and GitHub not only enhances students‚Äô effectiveness in conducting research projects by ensuring organized and reproducible workflows but also elevates their employability. The technical skills acquired in this course are increasingly sought after in various work settings, providing students with a competitive edge in today‚Äôs dynamic job market.\n\n\nMechanics\nGuided by the seminar instructor, participants will receive input while working through a dedicated Git Handbook (https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/) that is tuned to the structure of the course and needs of the students, as well as engaging in practical hands-on exercises with Git and GitHub."

We are excited that you have signed up for this course and can‚Äôt wait to delve into the world of version control with you. Our first session takes place next Monday, April 08, 2024, from 12:15 to 13:45 at Von-Melle-Park 5, Room 3016.\nIn order to tailor the course to your prior experience and needs, we have prepared a short survey with a few questions. Please complete the survey before our first session, ideally by Sunday evening (April 07, 2024). This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session on Monday.\nThe survey can be accessed here: https://version-control-intro.formr.org\nA few technical remarks about the survey: The survey will ask you for two codewords: a personal codeword and a course codeword.\nThe personal codeword is used to associate your responses with a unique identifier. This will allow us to identify and relate your responses across surveys while ensuring anonymity. By providing a personal codeword, you will allow us to draw more detailed insights from your responses that will help us improve the course for you. The survey will contain an explanation of how to generate your personal codeword.\nThe course codeword is used to tag your responses as coming from a course participant at University of Hamburg. We might also use the survey to collect responses from participants in other course settings. The course codeword allows us to distinguish responses from different course settings.\nThe course codeword is: -------- (course password will be announced during the course).\nApart from answering the survey, you don‚Äôt need to prepare anything else for our first session on Monday.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ss24\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you for the first session on Monday!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

Standing on the shoulders of Git and git-annex (git-annex.branchable.com, Joey Hess), DataLad provides a decentralized solution that enables the joint management of code, data, and complete containerized computational environments in a scalable and distributed fashion. With features such as unambiguous version control, a wide spectrum of data transport mechanisms, convenient provenance capture, and re-execution for verification or as an alternative to storage and transport, it enables and facilitates many aspects of open and reproducible science: collaboration, sharing, analytical transparency, computational reproducibility of digital research objects, and disk-space aware storage and computing workflows on infrastructure that ranges from personal laptops up to supercomputers."

Standing on the shoulders of Git and git-annex (git-annex.branchable.com, Joey Hess), DataLad provides a decentralized solution that enables the joint management of code, data, and complete containerized computational environments in a scalable and distributed fashion. With features such as unambiguous version control, a wide spectrum of data transport mechanisms, convenient provenance capture, and re-execution for verification or as an alternative to storage and transport, it enables and facilitates many aspects of open and reproducible science: collaboration, sharing, analytical transparency, computational reproducibility of digital research objects, and disk-space aware storage and computing workflows on infrastructure that ranges from personal laptops up to supercomputers."

This is one of the rare occasions when we will ask you to complete a small task outside of class time.\nWe are very much looking forward to our next session on Friday when we will take our first steps in using Git! For this session, it is important that you verify whether Git is installed on your computer. To do this, we kindly ask you to complete the following tasks before our session on Friday:\n\nPlease review the ‚ÄúInstallation‚Äù chapter in our course guide: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/installation.html\nComplete our survey regarding the installation process: https://version-control-installation.formr.org\n\nOverall, this should not take more than 15 minutes.\nPlease ensure that you complete the survey before our next session, ideally by Thursday evening (November 2nd, 2023). This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session on Friday.\nApart from checking your Git installation and answering the survey, you don‚Äôt need to prepare anything else for our next session on Friday.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/\nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you for the next session on Friday!\nBest wishes, Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

How would you retrieve the earlier brilliant version? Is it even possible?\n\n‚ÄúIn the past, I mostly worked with doc documents (word) and saved every day a new version when I was the only person working on the document. This was not very practical and I hope to learn an alternative during this course‚Äù\n\n(‚Ä¶) Consider a situation where you are working with five co-authors on a paper. How do you handle the changes and comments they make to the document\n\n‚ÄúI know that you can accept changes and comments in word, but I always find it confusing and complex to keep the overview. I don‚Äôt know what happens to the history of modifications.‚Äù"
