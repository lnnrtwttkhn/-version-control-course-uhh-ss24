Dear course participants,

Thank you for your good participation in the course "Track, organize and share your work: An introduction to Git for psychological research".
We have a few important announcements and tasks for you to complete.

First, please make sure to complete the course evaluation using the following link: https://evasys-online.uni-hamburg.de/evasys/online.php?p
swd=NWSWC.
\
Your feedback is very valuable to us.

Also, please remember our passing requirements (Quizzes and Repository tasks):

Almost everyone has completed all the necessary quizzes.
Attached to this email are the missing quizzes and their associated codewords.
(Only the quizzes in bold text need to be completed to pass.) If anything seems incorrect, please let us know immediately.
Additionally, please remember to send Christine an email with your codeword at sekretariat-luv.psych\@uni-hamburg.de.

Most of you have also completed all implementation tasks in your own repository.
To check your completion on GitHub: \
1.
Ensure your repository is public and all required files and pull requests are present.
\
2.
Verify that you have created and merged the necessary pull requests.
\
3.
Check that you have closed all relevant issues and implemented the suggested changes.
\
4.
Confirm that you have created a release of your repository.

We will review your repositories in a week, and you will receive an email if you have not already completed everything.

That's all for now.
Enjoy the summer!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
