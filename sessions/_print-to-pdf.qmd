To print the slides to PDF, do the following:

1.  Toggle into Print View using the <kbd>E</kbd> key (or using the [Navigation Menu](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#navigation-menu)).
2.  Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P).
3.  Change the **Destination** setting to **Save as PDF**.
4.  Change the **Layout** to **Landscape**.
5.  Change the **Margins** to **None**.
6.  Enable the **Background graphics** option.
7.  Click **Save**.

Note: This feature has been confirmed to work in [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome), [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) as well as in [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

Here's what the Chrome print dialog would look like with these settings enabled:
