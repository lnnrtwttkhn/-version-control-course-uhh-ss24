## Your feedack

... following [popular request](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-course-uhh-ss24/labels/feedback)

> [...] sometimes I loose track of where I am in the Git/GitHub Space.
Maybe you can create a "map" on how the things are related and which codes get me from one point to another?

> [...] Could you explain how Github enables us to see the version history and how we can access files at different time points?

> [...] For the last seminar sessions it might be interesting to look more into GUIs for Git.

> [...] what about GUIs?
Which one has which benefits and what are payment options?
Git kraken looked really promising, is it worth it?

> [...] I definitely support the plan to practice what we've learned so far so that I don't forget about it once the semester is over.
