## Email

Dear course participants,

This is a reminder to help you prepare for our upcoming seminar session on Monday by completing the exercises from the last sessions (if you have not done so yet):

1. Please ensure that you have uploaded ("pushed") your `recipes` repository to GitHub before our next session on Monday. 

2. Files that your repository should include are a `recipe.qmd` file (see exercise in Session 06 on "Quarto"), a `.gitignore` file (see exercise in Session 04 on "Basic Git workflow") and a `README.md` file (see exercise in Session 08 on "GitHub - Intro").
While this is not mandatory, please try to remove any unnecessary files or clutter, like empty `.txt` files from your repository.
You can delete files directly on GitHub by clicking on the three dots next to the directory or file and selecting "Delete file," then commit the changes. 
This effectively runs `git add` and `git commit` on GitHub.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us via email.

We look forward to seeing you next Monday!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
