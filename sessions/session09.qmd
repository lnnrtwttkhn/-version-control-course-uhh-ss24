Dear course participants,

We have a quick request to help you prepare for our upcoming seminar.

If you have not done so yet, please ensure that you have uploaded ("pushed") your repository to GitHubnbefore our next session on Monday. 

Files that your repository should include are the recipe.qmd file, the .gitignore file and a README.md file.
Please  try to remove any unnecessary files or clutter, like empty .txt files from your repository.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us via email.

We look forward to seeing you next week!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
