Dear course participants,

We have a last-minute preparation request for our seminar today (sorry, for the short notice, it will only take a few minutes):

Please ensure you have a working GitHub account before our next session today. 
If you do not have one yet, please create an account at <https://github.com/>.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us via email.

We look forward to seeing you later!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
