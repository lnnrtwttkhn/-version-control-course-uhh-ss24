## This session

In this session, you will complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the chapter ["First steps with Git"](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/first-steps-git.html) in the Version Control Book.
1. Complete the exercises for the [`recipes` project](#recipes-project).
1. Complete the [quiz](https://version-control-basics.formr.org/).

As always:

1. Try out the commands in the chapter and play around with them.
1. Check whether you have achieved the [learning objectives](#learning-objectives).

## `recipes` project

At the end of this session, you should have accomplished the following:

1. Commit at least three changes in `recipes.txt`.
1. Make at least one commit using `git commit --amend`.
    - For example, add a recipe without a title first, commit, then add a title and use `git commit --amend` to add the title change to the same commit.
1. Create a `.gitignore` file
    - Everyone: Create a random file that you want to ignore, for example `random-file.docx`.
    - All macOS users: Let your repository ignore `.DS_Store`
1. :rocket: Optional: Commit `.gitkeep` in an otherwise empty directory

Please keep the `recipes` folder!
We will continue to use it in the following sessions.
